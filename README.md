# PicoPlaca
A "pico y placa" predictor. The inputs should be a license plate number (the full number, not the last digit), a date (as a String), and a time, and the program will return wheter or not that car can be on the road. The resultant message will tell you if the car is affected or not by the "Pico y Placa".
